4398,2020-02-03,and how could i forget the completely relatable road rage IN the Audi!!!!!
4399,2020-02-03,Hot take: Arya Stark killing the Night King is preferable to Arya Stark driving an Audi while singing the Frozen song.

13780,2020-02-06,"But sir you- I don't think you hate black women, you just need to look at other views sometimes"" for someone to tell me to look at other views but gave narrow minded opinions then tried to force the hatred of black women on to me then take it back? Have the month you deserve."""

13805,2020-02-06,"He’s barking... like I got was she was saying and was all for it, until I opened the video and actually listened. She used a poor example. He’s literally barking."
13806,2020-02-06,It's official @ Audi RUINED the Q7 with the face-lift. What's with these ugly front lights that lack styling cohesion? And those plasticy lower front air-dams? And the worst part of the update? This new all touch-screen infotainment system! Why?? It's style of substance.
