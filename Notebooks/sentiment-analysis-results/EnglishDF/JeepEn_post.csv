1243,2020-02-03,The Groundhog Day (1993) movie had a budget of $14.6 million. The cost of 60 seconds worth of commercial airtime this year is $11.2 million. There's a good chance that Jeep's new Groundhog Day commercial cost more than the original movie after adding the production costs.

11351,2020-02-03,Amazon didn't name Ellen. Jeep didn't name Bill Murray. Rocket Mortgage didn't name Jason Momoa. P&G didn't name Sofia Vergara. Michelob didn't identify Jimmy Fallon. GM didn't name LeBron. The list goes on but Twitter only allows so many characters.
11352,2020-02-03,Best # SuperBowl commercial of the night @ Jeep
11353,2020-02-03,The Jeep is hideous but their commercial was great # balance
11354,2020-02-03,I can guarantee that @ Jeep commercial did not feature some knock off groundhog. Bill Murray knows what's up # SuperBowl # SuperBowlAdshttps://twitter.com/tgweeded/status/1223987839140057089 …

11370,2020-02-03,# Jeep commercial is best so far! # SuperBowl54 # BillMurray # GroundhogDay Billy’s original due date!
11371,2020-02-03,Best were the Wisconsin dog cancer research commercial and the groundhog jeep commercial... worst was definitely the entire halftime show
11372,2020-02-03,Wranglers are great... just not sold on that Gladiator. The truck + wrangler makes it seem weak on both fronts. Longer wheel base with road tires make it worse for off-road... underpowered engine not ideal for hauling.
11373,2020-02-03,"On a scale 1 - 10, 10 being the best. 8.8752222."

11390,2020-02-03,"Oh wow Jeep, even on Goundhog day. Brilliant. No day is the same in a Jeep."" This is brilliant. Jeep identifies as an ""adventurer"" brand archetype and no one who buys one wants to be stuck in a routine, or be perceived that way. # superbowl # marketing"""

11397,2020-02-03,The @ Jeep Groundhog’s Day commercial with Bill Murray is hysterical.

11411,2020-02-03,FABULOUS!!!!!!!!! @ jeep wins the # SuperBowl
11412,2020-02-03,You know what's sad about your commercial? It reminds me of the fight over water usage in different countries AND how the cartels have moved from drugs to this fruit to capitalize.
11413,2020-02-03,"Just saw the Jeep/groundhog day commercial, absolutely hilarious, just perfect."
11414,2020-02-03,I think the Jeep Groundhog Day commercial was my favorite... although MC Hammer Cheetos and Snickers Hole were pretty darn good. We won’t talk about Google Remember
11415,2020-02-03,I do love that but I think the Jeep commercial just took it. I mean come on it’s @ BillMurray and the # groundhogsdaymovie throw back.

12055,2020-02-03,Love the Jeep Ad. But seems like expensive for an ad that can only run once a year.
12056,2020-02-03,That and the Alexa commercials were probably the comedy gems of the day.
12057,2020-02-03,Best ad goes to # motherfuckingjeepstuff # jeep # jeepstuff # SuperBowl # SuperBowlLIV # JeepGroundhogDay # JeepGladiator # jeeplife # BillMurray

14429,2020-02-03,It is a great ad. What is it about Jeeps? I've never owned one but they have a visceral appeal to me. I drove by a blue jeep on Friday and I felt this overwhelming wave of jealousy. I've never owned a jeep and my car is good. I just really wanted that car. @ Jeep
14430,2020-02-03,Taking out Jeep ad! # bias The Goo5 ad was amazing!

14589,2020-02-03,The Bill Murray Jeep ad was good.
14590,2020-02-03,Not one to get into tweeting companies over their Super Bowl Ads but this is brilliantly done! It captures the same awesomeness as the film we all love! Well done!
14591,2020-02-03,The Avocado commercial was Stoopid!! I think Doritos probably has moved into 2nd place. The Hyundai commercial should be top 4 at least!! Before it's over Jeep will be up there with the Groundhog Day / Bill Murray commercial.
14592,2020-02-03,The Columbus Panhandles.... yes! That would have been sweet!!
