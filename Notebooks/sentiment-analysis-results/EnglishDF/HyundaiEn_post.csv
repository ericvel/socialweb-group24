3024,2020-02-03,Stuff I loved tonight: - Hulu/Tom Brady with the fake out that pivoted into their ad that literally no one expected. - Hyundai leaning into Boston vernacular for (making things for a small group of people that everyone loves) - Jeep playing into the moment and pop culture

6005,2020-02-03,The Hyundai Smaht Pahk ad used a different advertising execution style because it did not talk about the details of the car until the end. It wanted to gain your attention and have you hooked on the ad first. # NKUSBP

7066,2020-02-03,I own 2 Hyundais. (1 is only a year old) Both had to have engines replaced because they caught on fire while driving. Maybe @ Hyundai should focus on that instead of a car that parks itself.....

7363,2020-02-03,Awesome!
7364,2020-02-03,Hyundai forgot if everybody loved or hated Boston so they took a gamble (and lost)
7365,2020-02-03,Ok..the Hyundai ad was wicked good....I have to admit it!

7378,2020-02-03,# Hyundai with the “Summon” like feature @ Tesla At least someone is trying to copy you the right way
7379,2020-02-03,The fun thing about that spot in the Hyundai self-parking ad is that whoever is using the feature is being a complete dick when getting into and out of the car itself by blocking the normal flow of street traffic.
7380,2020-02-03,Also my hometown of # swampscott had its 1 second of fame in the # SuperBowl @ Hyundai ad
7381,2020-02-03,The Hyundai commercial was the best so far.
7382,2020-02-03,# Hyundai is winning so far and Idk why. Mostly because I wanted to have a threesome with my tv probably.
7383,2020-02-03,Hyundai obviously thought the Patriots were going to be in the Super Bowl when they produced that very funny Boston commercial. # SuperBowl2020

7450,2020-02-03,Hyundai should stick to shipping containers.

7841,2020-02-03,That Hyundai Sonata commercial was the dumbest commercial I have ever seen. Imo.

7858,2020-02-03,The Hyundai commercial though. @ ChrisEvans should always be in # SuperBowl commercials.
7859,2020-02-03,That Hyundai Sonata will not actually park in any of those places. Dorchester & the Harbor at least will get you some serious door dings—but you probably don’t care. You bought a Hyundai.

7940,2020-02-03,That Hyundai commercial tho
7941,2020-02-03,Hyundai’s use of the local Boston dialect to help its brand seem more “American” instead of foreign was unique and interesting.
7942,2020-02-03,"For this smart park thing with Hyundai - that’s great you can make your car auto park into tight spaces, but what happens when the guy next to you can’t get in his car?"
